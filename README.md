# Brainstorm Project

## Domain of Interest

Greenhouse and energy emissions have been increasing in the atmosphere at an alarming rate, impacting our environments and overall quality of life. And recent [studies](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/non-economic-data/happiest-countries) have revealed that the happiest countries are those prioritizing well-being and environmental sustainability. To explore this finding, our group is interested in understanding the association between happiness indicators/happiness scores and CO2, greenhouse gas, and energy emissions globally.

#### Examples of other data driven projects related to C02 and happiness:

["World Happiness"](http://www.alexanderbastidasfry.com/happy/)
- This project visualizes happiness by displaying a graph and chart with the key factors studied in the World Happiness Report for each country in the world.

["Fossil Fuel Emissions"](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions)
- This project displays the levels of different emission types in different countries or regions of the world. It also displays fossil fuel rankings for the top emissions countries.

["Happiness and Life Satisfaction"](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction)
- This project investigates life satisfaction and happiness in different regions of the world. It explores several factors that relate to happiness and provides information analyzing the data included in this project.

#### Questions to Consider:

> What are the CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions for every country in the world? What countries produce the least and which produced the most?
- We will use data sets that display the CO2 emissions from every country in the world. In particular we will examine emissions per capita to see how much each individual contributes to the pollution of our atmosphere.

> Which countries use the most energy per capita and how does energy usage compare with greenhouse gas emissions?
- We will use data on various forms of energy usage to deduce which countries use the most energy collectively and per-capita. We will then compare our finding with the data on CO2 emissions to see if there's overlap.

> Which countries are the happiest and what are the primary reasons for this happines or lack of it?
- We will be examining the happiness rank of countries around the world, and seeing how these countries rank in categories such as freedom, government trust and education levels. We will also connect this data with the energy usage and CO2 data sets to come to conclusions.

## Finding Data

[CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data#%EF%B8%8F-download-our-complete-co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dataset--csv--xlsx--json)
- Data is generated from combining from the Global Carbon Project, the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, CAIT Climate Data Explorer, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, IEA World Bank and World Development Indicators. Other sources include the United Nation, World Bank, Gapminder, the Maddison Project Database, and additional sources for additional variables included in this dataset.
- There are 24016 rows and 38 columns.


[Energy by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/energy-data)
- Data is generated from BP Statistical Review of World Energy, SHIFT Data Portal, EMBER - Global Electricity Dashboard. Other sources include the United Nation, World Bank, Gapminder, the Maddison Project Database, and additional sources for additional variables included in this dataset.
- There are 91 columns and 10159 rows.

[The World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- The data from the Gallup World Poll. The Gallup World Poll conducts surveys through phone calls in countries without at least an 80% phone coverage. Otherwise, they do face-to-face interviews in randomly selected households. The happiness score is generated by calculating economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.
- The data includes 5 CSVs that range from 2015 to 2019. Each CSV has 9 columns and 156 rows.
