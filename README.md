## Domain of Interest

Greenhouse and energy emissions have been increasing in the atmosphere at an alarming rate, impacting our environments and overall quality of life. And recent [studies] (https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/non-economic-data/happiest-countries) have revealed that the happiest countries are those prioritizing well-being and environmental sustainability. To explore this finding, our group is interested in understanding the association between happiness indicators/happiness scores and CO2, greenhouse gas, and energy emissions globally.

## Finding Data

[CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data#%EF%B8%8F-download-our-complete-co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dataset--csv--xlsx--json)
- Data is generated from combining from the Global Carbon Project, the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, CAIT Climate Data Explorer, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, IEA World Bank and World Development Indicators. Other sources include the UNited Nation, World Bank, Gapminder, the Maddison Project Database, and additional sources for additional variables included in this dataset.
- There are 24016 rows and 38 columns.


[Energy by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/energy-data)
- Data is generated from BP Statistical Review of World Energy, SHIFT Data Portal, EMBER - Global Electricity Dashboard. Other sources include the UNited Nation, World Bank, Gapminder, the Maddison Project Database, and additional sources for additional variables included in this dataset.
- There are 91 columns and 10159 rows.

[The World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- The data from the Gallup World Poll. The Gallup World Poll conducts surveys through phone calls in countries without at least an 80% phone coverage. Otherwise, they do face-to-face interviews in randomly selected households. The happiness score is generated by calculating economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.
- The data includes 5 CSVs that range from 2015 to 2019. Each CSV has 9 columns and 156 rows.
